## Description

{This app lets the user play the game Greedy Goblins against the computer. Originally designed as a simple card game, the rules of the game are:
Greedy Goblins is a quick game for 2 players. Each player takes the role of a warring goblin tribe fighting over the contents of a mine full of valuable gems, ores, and metals. 

Each game of Greedy Goblins consists of 9 rounds. At the start of the round each player plays one of their goblin cards face down. When both players have played their goblin cards reveal them.

If the total value of cards is 10 or less, then the goblins have successfully raided the mine. The player who played the higher value card earns a number of points equal to that cardâ€™s value.

If the total value of the cards is 11 or greater, then the goblins have caused a cave in. The player who played the higher value card loses a point. Players can go into negative points this way.
